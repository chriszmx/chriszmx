I build **high-performance web systems**, **SEO-first architectures**, and **AI automation pipelines** at **[Nine Lives Development](https://github.com/Nine-Lives-Dev)**.

SvelteKit-first. SEO from the foundation up. AI for operations, not hype. Web3 when it makes sense.

## [~] What I'm Building Right Now

**SEO-First Web Architecture**

-   Programmatic sitemap + robots generation for local SEO
-   Dynamic page generation with structured data (JSON-LD) baked in
-   Server-side rendering with edge functions for Core Web Vitals
-   Component libraries with strict accessibility and semantic HTML

**AI Automation Systems**

-   Lead qualification agents (chat → scoring → routing → CRM)
-   RAG-based assistants for internal docs and client knowledge bases
-   Prompt-driven content generation with versioned prompts
-   AI summaries for analytics, PRs, and activity tracking

**Business Automation Pipelines**

-   n8n workflows for lead ingestion, routing, and CRM sync
-   Event-driven tracking (GA4, GTM, Search Console integrations)
-   Webhook orchestration and background job systems
-   Zero-touch operations for client reporting and notifications

**Web3 Community Tools**

-   Solana wallet integrations and token-gated experiences
-   Treasury dashboards and staking analytics
-   Trading tools and internal bots (meme-driven but technically sound)

## [~] Engineering Approach

```txt
$ principles
1. Build fast, but design for longevity
2. Prefer boring tech that scales
3. Optimize for clarity over cleverness
4. Automation over manual process, always
5. SEO is architecture, not afterthought

$ anti-patterns
❌ WordPress theme flipping
❌ SEO snake oil
❌ Black-box AI magic
❌ Overengineering for ego
❌ Shipping without intent

$ workflow
requirements → architecture → implementation → deployment → monitoring → iteration
```

## [~] Technical Focus Areas

### Web Engineering (Core)

Building high-performance web applications with **SvelteKit-first** approach (React when client requires it).

-   Server-side rendering with edge functions for performance
-   Component-driven architecture with reusable, documented UI blocks
-   Tailwind-based design systems with strict consistency
-   Performance budgets tied to Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals
-   Accessibility and semantic HTML as default

### SEO-First Architecture (Not Just Meta Tags)

SEO built into the foundation from routing to content generation to performance.

-   Programmatic sitemaps and robots control
-   Dynamic page generation for local and vertical SEO
-   Structured data (JSON-LD) baked into page templates
-   Canonicalization and duplicate-content prevention
-   Performance optimization tied directly to search rankings

### AI-Powered Systems

Custom AI agents and automation that eliminate manual work and accelerate operations.

-   AI agents for content generation, QA, and lead qualification
-   Prompt-driven systems with versioned, tested prompts
-   Embeddings and vector search for RAG implementations
-   AI summaries for analytics and internal reporting
-   Privacy-aware, conversion-focused implementations

### Analytics & Data Pipelines

Event-driven tracking architecture for real insights, not vanity metrics.

-   GA4, GTM, and Search Console integrations
-   Form, call, and conversion tracking with attribution
-   Data normalization for dashboards and reporting
-   Privacy-aware tracking with explicit consent handling

### Backend & Infrastructure

Modern backend systems on **Firebase** and **Supabase** with production-grade security.

-   Cloud Functions for automation and orchestration
-   Webhooks and background jobs via n8n
-   Secure role-based access patterns
-   Environment-aware deployments (dev, staging, prod)

### Business Automation

Zero-touch operations systems that route leads, sync data, and eliminate busywork.

-   Lead ingestion and routing systems
-   CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, custom)
-   Notification pipelines (Telegram, Slack, email)
-   Scheduled reporting and client updates
